**Title:** 
Online Windowed Subsequence Matching over Probabilistic Sequences 

**Abstract:**
Windowed subsequence matching over deterministic strings has been studied
in previous work in the contexts of knowledge discovery, data mining, and
molecular biology. However, in these applications, as well as in data
stream monitoring, complex event processing, and time series data
processing in which streams can be mapped to strings, the strings are often
noisy and probabilistic. We study this problem in the online setting for
real-time query processing where efficiency is paramount. In this talk, I
discuss a suite of algorithms for this purpose, which includes an exact
algorithm, a randomized approximation algorithm with provable accuracy, a
filtering algorithm with adaptive optimization, and finally algorithms for
handling negations in patterns.
