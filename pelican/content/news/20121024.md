**Title:**
Truth Finding on the Deep Web 

**Abstract:** 
The Web has been changing our lives enormously and people rely more and more on
the Web to fulfill their information needs. Compared with traditional media,
information on the Web can be published fast, but with fewer guarantees on
quality and credibility. Indeed, Web sources are of different qualities,
sometimes providing conflicting, out-of-date and incomplete data.  The sources
can also easily copy, reformat and modify data from other sources, propagating
erroneous data.

In this talk we present a recent study for truthfulness of Deep Web data in two
domains where we believed data quality is important to people's lives: Stock
and Flight. We then describe how we can resolve conflicts from different
sources by leveraging accuracy of the sources and the copying relationships
between the sources using statistical models. We demo our SOLOMON system, which
can effectively detect copying between data sources, leverage the results in
truth discovery, and provide a user-friendly interface to facilitate users in
understanding the results.
