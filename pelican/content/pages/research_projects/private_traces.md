Communication traces are detailed records of communication between two entities
in a network. These traces arise in a variety of settings and include computer
network traces, phone toll records, instant messaging transcripts, among
others. Sharing of communication traces across institutions is critical for
network research into traffic analysis, communication protocols, routing and
security of communication networks. But the public release of these traces
remains highly constrained by privacy and security concerns. It is because the
traces contain highly sensitive information about the users of the network as
well as the network-sensitive information that could be used in attack against
the network.

The goal of this work is to understand the threats involved in publication of
communication traces and develop a framework to support their safe
dissemination. It is required that the published communication traces must have
high utility for the network researchers. The publications below address the
threats to privacy of the users in the communication traces and propose
framework that guarantees absolute utility to the network researchers while
protecting the privacy of the users.
