The goal of this project is to design and develop a stream processing system that captures data uncertainty from data collection to query processing to final result generation. Such uncertain data stream processing is crucial to many real-world applications such as hazardous weather monitoring and traffic monitoring.To achieve this goal, our project takes a principled approach grounded in probability and statistical theory to support uncertainty as a first-class citizen, and efficiently integrate this approach into high-volume stream processing. In particular, we aim to capture uncertainty of raw data streams as they are produced as well as changes of uncertainty as data propagates through various query processing operators.
