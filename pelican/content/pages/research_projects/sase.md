New! We are delighted to release the first version of SASE - SASE 1.0. ([more...](http://avid.cs.umass.edu/sase/index.php?page=code))

Today high-volume event streams naturally exist in a variety of environments
including sensing devices, financial services, network monitors, etc. An
increasing number of applications require that useful information be extracted
from such event streams in a timely manner. Such translation from event streams
to useful, actionable information is realized by a new processing paradigm
called complex event processing. CEP aims to provide a set of core functions:

* Filtering removes unwanted events
* Correlation detects complex patterns across different events.
* Aggregation computes aggregate values.
* Transformation generates new types of events.

To this end, we are designing and implementing a complex event processor, which we call SASE (Stream-based And Shared Event processing). SASE provides:

* A rich declarative event language
* Formal semantics of the event language
* Theorectical underpinnings of CEP
* An efficient automata-based implementation
