Recently, MapReduce has emerged as a popular programming model for processing
large datasets using a cluster of machines. However, the MapReduce model is
geared towards batch processing and requires the data set to be fully loaded
into the cluster before running analytical queries. In this project, we
examine, from a systems standpoint, what architectural design changes are
necessary to bring the benefits of the MapReduce model to low-latency
analytics. Our work includes theoretical and empirical analyses of existing
MapReduce systems and the proposal of a new data analysis platform that employs
advanced hashing and frequency analysis to enable scalable low-latency
analytics.
