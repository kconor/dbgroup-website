Recent advances in flash technology have enabled embedded devices, personal computers, and high-end servers to be equipped with high-capacity flash memory and its packaged devices such as solid state drives (SSDs). Flash memory and SSDs provide faster random access and more energy-efficiet operations over tradiational hard disks. In this project, we are designing new storage systems and query processing algorithms for large-scale data analysis and high-performance databases that employ hybrid storage of flash memory and hard disks.
