The database lab focuses on building systems for efficiently and securely
managing data. We are particularly interested in emerging data types like XML
and streaming data, and on embedded systems architectures.

Our current research projects include:


* [SCALLA: Scalable Low-Latency Analytics](|filename|./research_projects/scalla.md)
* [CLARO: Uncertain Data Stream Processing](|filename|./research_projects/claro.md)
* [STONES: Flash-based Data Management System](|filename|./research_projects/stones.md)
* [SASE: Complex Event Procesing over Streams](|filename|./research_projects/sase.md)
* [SPIRE: RFID Data Stream Processing](|filename|./research_projects/spire.md)
* [Private Dissemination of Tabular Data](|filename|./research_projects/private_tables.md)
* [Private Dissemination of Social Network Data](|filename|./research_projects/private_friends.md)
* [Private Dissemination of Communication Traces](|filename|./research_projects/private_traces.md)
* [Securing History](|filename|./research_projects/secure_history.md)
